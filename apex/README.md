# Apex Module – MambaDev

This module consolidates all Apex development standards and best practices used in MambaDev projects. Each subfolder represents a specific domain of expertise, from layered architecture to logging, testing, sandbox automation and operational comparison patterns.

## Folder Structure

| Folder          | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `comparison/`   | Refactor comparisons, equivalence checklists, and review-oriented guides |
| `fundamentals/` | Core architectural rules, naming conventions, and checklists             |
| `integrations/` | API integration patterns, especially for REST and webhooks               |
| `logging/`       | Structured logging stack, Logger class, and persistent logs              |
| `sandbox/`       | Post-refresh automation and org initialization                           |
| `testing/`       | Unit test architecture, factories, and test patterns                     |
| `examples/`      | Reference code and reusable implementation examples                      |

## Key Principles

- Apex code must be modular, testable, and maintainable
- Logging and error handling are not optional – they are standard
- Functional equivalence must be proven when refactoring
- Tests must validate logic, not implementation quirks
- Each folder here exists to enforce a strategic pattern of excellence

## Recommended Reading Order

1. `fundamentals/review-checklist.md`
2. `layered-architecture.md`
3. `exception-util.md`
4. `logging/logger-guide.md`
5. `testing/testing-patterns.md`
6. `comparison/apex-feature-comparison.md`

> MambaDev Apex isn’t about writing code. It’s about building unbreakable systems.

## ⚫ Mamba Mentality

We don’t build for today.  
We build for the developer who inherits this tomorrow.  
We leave behind clarity, precision, and structure.

> Every class is a contract.  
> Every exception has meaning.  
> Every log is a traceable artifact of intent.

**Welcome to the elite. Now execute.**
