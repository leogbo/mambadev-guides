# Logging Guide Folder

This folder contains all resources related to **structured logging**, **exception traceability**, and **observability architecture** within the MambaDev Apex framework.

## Included Guides

- ['logger-implementation.md'](https://mambadev.io/logger-implementation): Implementation and usage of the custom Logger class.
- ['flow-execution-log.md'](https://mambadev.io/flow-execution-log)`: Persistent logging object and logging stack architecture.

## Purpose

Logging is not just debug output — it’s a core pillar of operational excellence.
This content ensures:
- All logs follow a consistent, queryable format
- Errors are traceable across layers and systems
- Logs are actionable for both devs and support teams

> System.debug() is not enough. Mamba logs to win.
