# Comparison Guide Folder

This folder contains advanced guides related to **Apex code comparison**, **refactoring discipline**, and **functional equivalence validation** – all core practices in the MambaDev engineering culture.

## Included Guides

- `apex-feature-comparison.md`: How to structure before/after comparisons to validate refactors.
- `equivalence-checklist.md`: What must be verified to ensure your refactor maintains behavior.

## Purpose

Comparing code before and after changes is **mandatory** for all impactful modifications. This folder centralizes the material needed to:
- Create structured and auditable comparisons
- Document PRs with clarity and discipline
- Apply Mamba principles of safety and performance

> Mamba doesn’t improvise refactors. Mamba proves them.
