# 🌐 Integrations Module – MambaDev

This folder defines the standards, utilities, and patterns for building **predictable, traceable, and testable integrations** using Apex. It currently covers **REST APIs**, with planned expansions into:

- ✅ Outbound HTTP callouts
- 🔄 Bi-directional sync contracts
- 🔐 Token-based authentication strategies
- 📡 Webhook patterns and platform events
- 🧪 Mocking and interception for external dependencies

---

## 📚 Included Guides

- [REST API Guide](rest-api-guide.md): Core principles, structure, and tests for building public/internal APIs using `RestServiceHelper`

---

## 🎯 Purpose

MambaDev integrations are built to:

- **Enforce structured communication** between systems  
- **Handle failures** with meaningful logs and standardized errors  
- **Prevent chaos** with full request validation and traceability  
- **Avoid boilerplate** by using utilities like `RestServiceHelper` and `Logger`  
- **Enable full test coverage** even on edge cases

> An integration is not an afterthought.  
> It’s a contract. And Mamba signs every one.

## 🧠 Patterns You’ll Find Here

| Topic                      | Purpose                                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `RestServiceHelper`       | Parse, validate, and respond to API calls |
| `Logger` + `LoggerMock`   | Trace external requests, errors, and retries |
| `FlowExecutionLog__c`     | Persist context across integrations        |
| `AccessException`, `BadRequestException` | Semantic failure mapping          |
| `TestDataSetup`           | Create valid test payloads and stubs      |

## 🔒 Mamba Integration Mentality

- No `System.debug()` — only structured logs  
- No hardcoded responses — only testable stubs  
- No hand-coded `JSON.deserialize()` — only validated payloads  
- No trust without traceability

---

🧠 Build integrations like they're open to the world.  
Even if they aren't — yet.
