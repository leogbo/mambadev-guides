# 🌐 Integrations Module – MambaDev

This folder defines the standards, utilities, and patterns for building **predictable, traceable, and testable integrations** using Apex. It currently covers **REST APIs**, with planned expansions into:

- ✅ Outbound HTTP callouts  
- 🔄 Bi-directional sync contracts  
- 🔐 Token-based authentication strategies  
- 📡 Webhook patterns and platform events  
- 🧪 Mocking and interception for external dependencies  

---

## 📚 Included Guides

- [REST API Guide](rest-api-guide.md): Structure, patterns, and tests for public/internal APIs using [`RestServiceHelper`](rest-api-guide.md#what-is-restservicehelper)  
- [Callout Patterns](callout-patterns.md): Retryable, mockable, and logger-powered external HTTP callouts  
- [Webhook Strategy](webhook-strategy.md): Traceable, idempotent, and secure inbound webhook processing  
- [Auth Token Design](auth-token-design.md): Best practices for token validation, mocking, and secure access headers

---

## 🎯 Purpose

MambaDev integrations are built to:

- **Enforce structured communication** between systems  
- **Handle failures** with meaningful logs and standardized errors  
- **Prevent chaos** with full request validation and traceability  
- **Avoid boilerplate** by using [`RestServiceHelper`](rest-api-guide.md) and [`Logger`](../logging/logger-implementation.md)  
- **Enable full test coverage** even on edge cases using [`LoggerMock`](../logging/logger-mock.md) and [`TestDataSetup`](../testing/test-data-setup.md)

> An integration is not an afterthought.  
> It’s a contract. And Mamba signs every one.

## 🧠 Patterns You’ll Find Here

| Topic                                  | Purpose                                        |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| [`RestServiceHelper`](rest-api-guide.md)       | Parse, validate, and respond to API calls      |
| [`Logger`](../logging/logger-implementation.md) + [`LoggerMock`](../logging/logger-mock.md) | Trace external requests, errors, and retries |
| [`FlowExecutionLog__c`](../logging/flow-execution-log.md) | Persist context across integrations            |
| [`AccessException`](rest-api-guide.md#built-in-response-methods), [`BadRequestException`](rest-api-guide.md#built-in-response-methods) | Semantic failure mapping |
| [`TestDataSetup`](../testing/test-data-setup.md) | Create valid test payloads and stubs           |

## 🔒 Mamba Integration Mentality

- ❌ No `System.debug()` — only structured logs  
- ❌ No hardcoded responses — only testable stubs  
- ❌ No hand-coded `JSON.deserialize()` — only validated payloads  
- ❌ No trust without traceability  

---

🧠 Build integrations like they're open to the world.  
Even if they aren't — yet.
