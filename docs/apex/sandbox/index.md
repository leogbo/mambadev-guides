# Sandbox Guide Folder

This folder contains operational guides for managing **sandbox initialization**, environment setup, and post-refresh automation inside Salesforce environments.

## Included Guides

- `sandbox-init-guide.md`: Full breakdown of what to configure when a new sandbox is created or refreshed.

## Purpose

Sandboxes must behave like production-ready spaces. This folder helps developers:
- Set critical custom settings and data
- Automate Org initialization logic
- Validate logs and exception handling from the start

> A clean sandbox is the launchpad for serious delivery.
