# Testing Guide Folder

This folder contains guides focused on **unit testing patterns**, **test data management**, and **assertion discipline** within Apex development. These resources define the MambaDev standard for Apex test quality and repeatability.

## Included Guides

- [testing-patterns.md](https://mambadev.io/testing-patterns): Defines structure, philosophy, and best practices for Apex tests.
- [apex-testing-guide.md](https://mambadev.io/apex-testing-guide): Explains how to create isolated, reusable and robust test data factories.

## Purpose

This content ensures every developer:
- Writes meaningful, stable, and efficient unit tests
- Validates business logic independently from data
- Leverages factory methods and utilities for long-term maintainability

> If it’s not testable, it’s not shippable.
